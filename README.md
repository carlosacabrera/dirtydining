# Dirty Dining ðŸ’©

`Where not to eat in Florida.`

## Getting Started

### Installing dependencies

You will need Node, Watchman, the React Native command line interface, and Xcode.

While you can use any editor of your choice to develop your app, you will need to install Xcode in order to set up the necessary tooling to build your React Native app for iOS.

### Node, Watchman

We recommend installing Node and Watchman using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/). Run the following commands in a Terminal after installing Homebrew:

`brew install node brew install watchman`

If you have already installed Node on your system, make sure it is version 4 or newer.

[Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman) is a tool by Facebook for watching changes in the filesystem. It is highly recommended you install it for better performance.

### Running the application

To run your app on iOS:

1. `react-native run-ios`

   * or -

2. Open ios/DirtyDining.xcodeproj in Xcode

3. Hit the Run button

To run your app on Android:

1. Have an Android emulator running \(quickest way to get started\), or a device connected 
2. `react-native run-android`
