# Running the React Native application

To run your app on iOS:

1. `react-native run-ios`

   * or -

2. Open ios/DirtyDining.xcodeproj in Xcode

3. Hit the Run button

To run your app on Android:

1. Have an Android emulator running \(quickest way to get started\), or a device connected 
2. `react-native run-android`

## Running on a device

The above command will automatically run your app on the iOS Simulator by default. If you want to run the app on an actual physical iOS device, please follow the instructions [here](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/running-on-device.html).

## Using Developer Tools
