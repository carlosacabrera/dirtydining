# Tech Stack

* [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) uses the same fundamental UI building blocks as regular iOS and Android apps. You just put those building blocks together using JavaScript and React.

* [Redux](http://redux.js.org) is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments \(client, server, and native\), and are easy to test.

* [React Native Map by Airbnb](https://github.com/airbnb/react-native-maps) is a Map component for iOS + Android

* [GraphQL](http://graphql.org) is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data.
